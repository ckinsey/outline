RePlan App
=============

A very basic resource planning application.

Currently in development here: http://onec.me:45000

Local development
------------------

Powered by the ubiquitous Makefile ... this should be pretty easy:

1. make install
2. make run

You will need a handful of development headers:

  * libmemcached-dev
  * libfreetype6-dev
  * libjpeg-dev

These will be a bit tricky to install on a Mac, but not 
impossible either. The most onerous part will be installing
XCode tools for the actual compilation. After that, the magical
homebrew tool will do the heavy lifting.
